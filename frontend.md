Of course. For the MVP of your MEV-resistant DEX, the Next.js frontend is where the user interacts with the system and where the critical client-side encryption happens. It should be designed to be intuitive for users familiar with existing DEXs, while clearly communicating the added security benefits.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what the frontend should contain, organized by components and functionality.

### **1. Core UI Components**

The user interface should be clean, responsive, and provide a familiar trading experience. Drawing inspiration from the structure of modern dApps, like the `vrf-example` you're familiar with, is a good approach.

  * **Header / Navigation Bar:**

      * **`WalletConnect` Component:** A prominent button to connect and disconnect a user's wallet (e.g., "Connect Wallet"). It should display the user's address and network status (e.g., "Connected to Base Sepolia") once connected.
      * **Navigation Links:** Simple links to the main "Swap" page and potentially a "Learn More" or "About" page explaining the MEV protection.

  * **Main Swap Interface (`SwapCard.tsx`):**

      * **Token Inputs:** Two fields for selecting the "From" and "To" tokens, complete with balance displays.
      * **Amount Inputs:** Fields for the user to enter the amount they wish to trade.
      * **Price Information:** Display the current estimated exchange rate.
      * **"Swap" Button:** The primary call-to-action button that initiates the encryption and transaction submission process.

  * **Settings Panel (Modal or Dropdown):**

      * **Slippage Tolerance:** An input for users to set their maximum acceptable price change (e.g., 0.5%, 1%). This is a standard and essential feature to protect against normal price volatility, even with MEV protection.
      * **Transaction Deadline:** An input to set a time limit after which the transaction will automatically fail if not executed. This prevents transactions from getting stuck indefinitely.

  * **Transaction Status Display:**

      * A section to show recent transactions and their current state. This is crucial for user feedback in a multi-step process.
      * **States to track:**
        1.  `Encrypting...` (Client-side process)
        2.  `Awaiting Signature...` (Wallet prompt)
        3.  `Submitted & Shielded` (Transaction sent to the encrypted mempool)
        4.  `Included in Block` (Sequencer has committed to the transaction order)
        5.  `Executing...` (Transaction has been decrypted and is being processed)
        6.  `Success` or `Failed`

### **2. Key Functionality & Logic**

This is the "engine" of your frontend, handling all the cryptographic operations and blockchain interactions.

  * **Wallet & Blockchain Interaction (`/lib/blockchain.ts`):**

      * **Provider Setup:** Use `viem` or `ethers.js` to establish a connection to the Base Sepolia network via the user's wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask).
      * **Contract Instances:** Create instances of your deployed Solidity contracts (`BatcherContract`, `ExecutorContract`, etc.) so the frontend can call their functions.
      * **Transaction Submission:** Logic to construct and send the transaction to the `BatcherContract`. The key difference from a standard DEX is that the `data` field of this transaction will contain the *ciphertext*, not the plaintext trade details.

  * **Client-Side Encryption (`/lib/encryption.ts`):**

      * **Fetch Public Key:** The application must have a mechanism to fetch the current public encryption key from the Keyper committee. For an MVP, this could be hardcoded or fetched from a simple API endpoint you control.
      * **Encryption Function:** This is the core of the MEV protection. Before a transaction is sent, this function will:
        1.  Take the user's trade details (token addresses, amounts, slippage, deadline) as input.
        2.  Use a JavaScript cryptography library to encrypt this data payload with the fetched public key.
        3.  Return the resulting ciphertext, ready to be sent to the smart contract.

  * **State Management (`/app/providers.tsx`):**

      * Use React's built-in state management (Context API, `useState`, `useEffect`) or a library like React Query to manage application state.
      * Track wallet connection status, user inputs, transaction statuses, and any error messages.

### **3. Example File Structure (Next.js App Router)**

A logical file structure will make the project easier to manage.

```
/app
├── /swap
│   └── page.tsx         # Main page containing the swap interface
├── layout.tsx           # Root layout, includes providers
├── providers.tsx        # Wraps the app with Wallet and other providers
└── globals.css          # Global styles

/components
├── WalletConnect.tsx    # Wallet connection button and logic
├── SwapCard.tsx         # The main swap interface component
├── SettingsModal.tsx    # Modal for slippage/deadline settings
└── TransactionStatus.tsx # Component to display transaction progress

/lib
├── blockchain.ts        # Ethers.js/viem setup, contract addresses, ABIs
└── encryption.ts        # Logic for fetching the public key and encrypting data
