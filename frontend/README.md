## Design Principles

### Brutalist Aesthetics
- **Bold Typography**: Heavy, uppercase headings with strong visual hierarchy
- **High Contrast**: Black borders and text on white/pink/yellow backgrounds
- **Geometric Shapes**: Sharp edges, thick borders, and structured layouts
- **Visual Impact**: Large buttons, prominent call-to-actions, and clear information hierarchy

### Color System
- **Primary Pink**: #FF6B9D - Used for main actions and highlights
- **Primary Yellow**: #FFD93D - Used for secondary actions and accents
- **Primary Black**: #000000 - Used for text, borders, and primary buttons
- **Primary White**: #FFFFFF - Used for backgrounds and contrast

### Component Patterns
- **Cards**: 3px black borders with 6px drop shadows
- **Buttons**: Bold, uppercase text with hover animations and state changes
- **Inputs**: Thick borders with focus states using pink shadows
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded indicators for different campaign states
