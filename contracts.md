Of course. Here is a detailed breakdown of what the Solidity smart contracts for the MEV-resistant DEX MVP should contain.

The on-chain architecture should be modular, separating responsibilities into distinct contracts. This approach is inspired by proven threshold encryption systems like Shutter Network and is designed for clarity, security, and future upgradeability. The system will revolve around a core trio of contracts: a `ConfigContract`, a `BatcherContract`, and an `ExecutorContract`.

### **1. `ConfigContract.sol`**

This contract acts as the central source of truth for the system's parameters. It is designed to be managed by a DAO or a multisig wallet, allowing for secure and transparent governance over the DEX's operational rules.

**Purpose:** To store and manage all critical system parameters, which can be updated over time through a governed process.

**Key State Variables and Structs:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract ConfigContract {
    struct BatchConfig {
        uint64 startBatchIndex;
        uint64 startBlockNumber;
        uint32 batchSpan; // Duration of each batch in blocks
        address keypers; // List of committee member addresses
        uint32 threshold; // Decryption threshold
        uint64 transactionSizeLimit; // Max size of one encrypted transaction
        uint64 batchSizeLimit; // Max total size of all txs in a batch
        address feeReceiver;
        address targetAddress; // The ExecutorContract address
        bytes4 targetFunctionSelector; // The function to call on the executor
    }

    // An array to store all scheduled configurations
    BatchConfig public configs;
    address public owner; // The DAO or multisig address

    // Mapping to quickly find the active config for a given batch index
    mapping(uint64 => uint256) public batchIndexToConfigIndex;
}
```

**Key Functions:**

  * **`scheduleNextConfig(...)`:** An owner-only function to schedule a new configuration for a future set of batches. This two-step process (drafting then scheduling) gives the off-chain committee nodes ("Keypers") time to adapt to changes.
  * **`getConfigForBatch(uint64 batchIndex)`:** A view function that allows other contracts and off-chain services to retrieve the active configuration for a specific batch.
  * **`setNext...()` functions:** A series of owner-only functions to draft the parameters for the next configuration before it is scheduled (e.g., `setNextKeypers`, `setNextBatchSpan`).

### **2. `BatcherContract.sol`**

This contract is the primary on-chain entry point for users. It is responsible for receiving encrypted transactions and organizing them into batches according to the rules defined in the `ConfigContract`.

**Purpose:** To accept and batch encrypted user transactions.

**Key State Variables:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "./ConfigContract.sol";

contract BatcherContract {
    ConfigContract public configContract;
    uint64 public nextBatchIndex;

    // Event to signal that an encrypted transaction has been submitted
    event TransactionAdded(
        uint64 indexed batchIndex,
        bytes encryptedTransaction
    );

    constructor(address _configContractAddress) {
        configContract = ConfigContract(_configContractAddress);
        // Initialization logic for nextBatchIndex
    }
}
```

**Key Functions:**

  * **`submitTransaction(bytes calldata _encryptedTx)`:** This is the main function users will call. It accepts the ciphertext generated by the frontend.
      * It first determines the current `batchIndex` based on the current `block.number`.
      * It fetches the active configuration from the `ConfigContract` for that batch.
      * It performs basic validation, such as checking if the `_encryptedTx` size is within the `transactionSizeLimit`.
      * It emits a `TransactionAdded` event. Off-chain sequencers will listen for this event to collect the encrypted transactions for inclusion in a block.

### **3. `ExecutorContract.sol`**

This contract is responsible for executing the trades once they have been decrypted. It is designed to be called by a trusted sequencer or an automated system that has access to the decrypted transaction payloads.

**Purpose:** To execute a batch of decrypted transactions in a fixed, pre-committed order.

**Key State Variables:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "./ConfigContract.sol";

contract ExecutorContract {
    ConfigContract public configContract;
    address public sequencer; // The authorized address that can execute batches

    // This could be the address of your actual DEX logic contract (e.g., Uniswap V2 Router)
    address public dexRouter; 

    modifier onlySequencer() {
        require(msg.sender == sequencer, "Caller is not the sequencer");
        _;
    }

    constructor(address _configContractAddress, address _sequencerAddress, address _dexRouter) {
        configContract = ConfigContract(_configContractAddress);
        sequencer = _sequencerAddress;
        dexRouter = _dexRouter;
    }
}
```

**Key Functions:**

  * **`executeBatch(bytes calldata _decryptedTransactions)`:** An `onlySequencer` function that takes an array of decrypted transaction payloads.
      * It iterates through the `_decryptedTransactions` array in the exact order provided.
      * For each decrypted payload, it uses a low-level `call` to the `dexRouter` contract to execute the actual swap. The function signature and parameters for the swap are encoded within the decrypted payload. This ensures that the `ExecutorContract` itself doesn't need to know the specific logic of every possible trade.
      * This enforces the "execute" part of the "commit-decrypt-execute" workflow, ensuring that the final on-chain execution matches the order the sequencer committed to *before* decryption occurred.

### **How They Work Together**

1.  **Setup:** The `ConfigContract` is deployed and configured by the project's governance. The addresses of the `BatcherContract` and `ExecutorContract` are set.
2.  **Submission:** A user's Next.js app encrypts their trade details and calls `submitTransaction` on the `BatcherContract`. The contract emits an event with the ciphertext.
3.  **Commitment (Off-Chain):** A sequencer listens for these events, collects the ciphertexts for the current batch, and commits to a specific order for them in a new block on Base Sepolia.
4.  **Decryption (Off-Chain):** The Keyper committee sees the finalized block with the ordered ciphertexts and releases the decryption key for that batch.
5.  **Execution:** The sequencer decrypts the transactions and calls `executeBatch` on the `ExecutorContract`, passing the decrypted payloads in the pre-committed order. The `ExecutorContract` then executes the swaps against the DEX router.
